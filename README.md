# VandyTom2018
Vanderbilt TOM Make-a-thon to enable children with various disabilities to play normally
Created: 01/19/2018

Goals: 

Beginner Mode for FluidMotionDevice2.2.ino (possible to extend to scooty_puff_jr_v2.ino as well)
-A switch based mode that allows for a tapping motion of the forward motion button to work as acceleration
-Allow for some level of delay between taps without stopping the vehicle
-Do not dangerously extend stopping time or distance
-Do not use just one large 'delay' statement to reduce avoidable code slowing
